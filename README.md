# courseraGettingAndCleaning

Thes repo presents the solution of Yves Langeraert answering the exercise covering getting and cleaning data - Data Science track on Coursera.

When the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset was downloaded, this has been unzipped into ../getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset_2
The R file should thus be pasted into this folder. It will automatically go through the relevant folders to find its necessary resources.
The result "tidy_data.txt" will be saved in the root folder as well, being ../getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset_2.

More information about the work performed can be found in codebook.md
The script is aligned with the codebook, commented and stored as "run_analysis.R"
